- **Simple controls:** Start / Pause / Resume / Restart + Reset
- **Smart display:** Shows `hh:mm:ss` only when hours are needed
- **Keyboard-friendly labels & accessible buttons**
- **Dark / Light theme** (via settings)
- **Responsive UI** that looks great on mobile and desktop
- **Privacy-first:** No backend, no trackers beyond optional Vercel Analytics
